    "Boosting is an ensemble technique in machine learning where multiple models (typically weak learners) are trained sequentially, with each new model being trained to correct the errors made by the previous ones. The idea is to combine these simple models into a single composite model that performs better than any of the individual models alone."

After the first model is trained, the algorithm increases the weight of instances that were misclassified and decreases the weight of those that were classified correctly. This way, subsequent models focus more on the difficult cases that previous models got wrong. This process is repeated for a number of iterations, and the final model is typically a weighted average of all these weak learners."
